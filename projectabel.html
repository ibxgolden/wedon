<!-- HTML and XHTML Features
HTML and XHTML are two of the most popular markup languages used for developing web pages 
and applications. HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages, while XHTML
 is a stricter and more standardized version of HTML. Both HTML and XHTML include a wide
  range of features, such as support for multimedia, styling, and scripting.

HTML and XHTML both have features to create rich and interactive web pages and applications. 
Some of the most popular HTML and XHTML features include:

Support for multimedia: Both HTML and XHTML support various forms of multimedia, such as
 images, video, and audio. HTML also supports animated images and graphics.
Styling: Both HTML and XHTML offer a wide range of options for styling web pages. CSS 
(Cascading Style Sheets) is the most commonly used style sheet language, and it can be 
used to style both HTML and XHTML documents.
Scripting: HTML and XHTML both support various forms of scripting, such as JavaScript. 
Scripting can be used to add interactivity to web pages and applications.
Forms: Forms are one of the most important features of HTML and XHTML. Forms allow users 
to input data, which can then be processed by a server-side script.
Tables: Tables are another important feature of HTML and XHTML. Tables can be used to display 
tabular data, such as product information or financial data.
Links: Links are one of the most basic features of HTML and XHTML. Links allow users to 
navigate between web pages.
Metadata: Metadata is information about a web page or document. It can include information
 such as the author, keywords, and description.
HTML and XHTML are two of the most popular markup languages used for developing web pages
 and applications. Both HTML and XHTML include a wide range of features, such as support
  for multimedia, styling, and scripting. HTML is the standard markup language for creating
   web pages, while XHTML is a stricter and more standardized version of HTML -->
   <!-- The Most Important Differences from HTML
<!DOCTYPE> is mandatory
The xmlns attribute in <html> is mandatory
<html>, <head>, <title>, and <body> are mandatory
Elements must always be properly nested
Elements must always be closed
Elements must always be in lowercase
Attribute names must always be in lowercase
Attribute values must always be quoted
Attribute minimization is forbidden -->

<!-- XHTML vs HTML Specification
HTML and XHTML are closely related and therefore can be documented together. Both HTML
 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 have three sub specifications – strict, loose and frameset. The 
 difference opening declarations for a document distinguishes HTML and XHTML. Other 
 differences are syntactic. HTML allows shortcuts like elements with optional tags,
  empty elements without end tags. XHTML is very strict about opening and closing tags.
   XHTML uses built in language defining functionality attribute. All syntax requirements 
   of XML are included in a well formed XHTML document.

Note, though, that these differences apply only when an XHTML document is served as an 
application of XML; that is, with a MIME type of application/xhtml+xml, application/xml,
 or text/xml. An XHTML document served with a MIME type of text/html must be parsed and 
 interpreted as HTML, so the HTML rules apply in this case. A style sheet written for an
  XHTML document being served with a MIME type of text/html may not work as intended if 
  the document is then served with a MIME type of application/xhtml+xml. For more
   information about MIME types, make sure to read MIME Types.

This can be especially important when you’re serving XHTML documents as text/html. 
Unless you’re aware of the differences, you may create style sheets that won’t work 
as intended if the document’s served as real XHTML.

Where the terms “XHTML” and “XHTML document” appear in the remainder of this section,
 they refer to XHTML markup served with an XML MIME type. XHTML markup served as text/html 
 is an HTML document as far as browsers are concerned. -->

 <!--   Similarities between the two:
Basic Structure:
Both XHTML and HTML5 have the same basic structure, consisting of a head and a body. 
The head contains information about the document, such as the title and any scripts 
or stylesheets. The body contains the content that is displayed on the web page.
Semantics:
Both XHTML and HTML5 use semantic markup, which means that the tags used to structure
 the content are meaningful and descriptive. This helps search engines and screen readers
  to understand the content and improve accessibility.
Browser Support:
Both XHTML and HTML5 are supported by all modern web browsers. This means that web 
developers can choose either language and be confident that their pages will be displayed 
correctly in most browsers.
Separation of Content and Presentation:
Both XHTML and HTML5 encourage the separation of content and presentation, which means 
that the content should be structured using semantic markup, while the presentation
 should be handled separately using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).
Accessibility:
Both XHTML and HTML5 prioritize accessibility and provide tools and techniques for 
creating accessible web pages. This includes using semantic markup, providing alternative 
text for images, and using ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes to 
improve accessibility for screen readers and other assistive technologies-->
